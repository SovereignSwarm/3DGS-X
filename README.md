**Capture and store real-world data on Meta Quest 3 or 3s, including HMD/controller poses, stereo passthrough images, camera metadata, and depth maps.**

---

## 📖 Overview

`QuestRealityCapture` is a Unity-based data logging app for Meta Quest 3. It captures and stores synchronized real-world information such as headset and controller poses, images from both passthrough cameras, camera characteristics, and depth data, organized per session.

For **data parsing, visualization, and reconstruction**, refer to the companion project:
**[Meta Quest 3D Reconstruction](https://github.com/t-34400/metaquest-3d-reconstrucion)**

This includes:

* Scripts for **loading and decoding** camera poses, intrinsics, and depth descriptors
* Conversions of **raw YUV images** and **depth maps** to usable formats (RGB, point clouds)
* Utilities for **reconstructing 3D scenes** using [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/)
* Export pipelines to prepare data for **SfM/SLAM tools** like **COLMAP**

---

## ✅ Features

* Records HMD and controller poses (in Unity coordinate system)
* Captures **YUV passthrough images** from **both left and right cameras**
* Logs **Camera2 API characteristics** and image format information
* Saves **depth maps** and **depth descriptors** from both cameras
* **Synchronized capture** with configurable frame rate for depth and camera images (default: 3 FPS)
* **Perfect timestamp alignment** between camera images and depth maps
* Automatically organizes logs into timestamped folders on internal storage

## 📢 NOTICE (v1.1.0)

Starting with version **1.1.0**, the **camera pose values** stored in `left_camera_characteristics.json` and `right_camera_characteristics.json` are now saved as **raw pose values directly obtained from the Android Camera2 API**.

### Migration Guide for Older Logs (v1.0.x and earlier)

In versions **prior to 1.1.0**, the camera poses were preprocessed into Unity coordinate space. To convert these older poses to match the new raw format convention, apply the following transformation:

* **Translation (position)**:

  ```
  (x, y, z) → (x, y, -z)
  ```

* **Rotation (quaternion)**:

  ```
  (x, y, z, w) → (-x, -y, z, w)
  ```

This conversion aligns the preprocessed Unity pose with the raw Android pose representation now used in version 1.1.0 and later.

## 🧾 Data Structure

Each time you start recording, a new folder is created under:

```
/sdcard/Android/data/com.t34400.QuestRealityCapture/files
```

Example structure:

```
/sdcard/Android/data/com.t34400.QuestRealityCapture/files
└── YYYYMMDD_hhmmss/
    ├── hmd_poses.csv
    ├── left_controller_poses.csv
    ├── right_controller_poses.csv
    │
    ├── left_camera_raw/
    │   ├── <unixtimeMs>.yuv
    │   └── ...
    ├── right_camera_raw/
    │   ├── <unixtimeMs>.yuv
    │   └── ...

    ├── left_camera_image_format.json
    ├── right_camera_image_format.json

## 📄 Data Format Details

### Pose CSV

* Files: `hmd_poses.csv`, `left_controller_poses.csv`, `right_controller_poses.csv`
* Format:

  ```
  unix_time,ovr_timestamp,pos_x,pos_y,pos_z,rot_x,rot_y,rot_z,rot_w
  ```

### Camera Characteristics (JSON)

* Obtained via Android Camera2 API
* Includes pose, intrinsics (fx, fy, cx, cy), sensor info, etc.

### Image Format (JSON)

* Includes resolution, format (e.g., `YUV_420_888`), per-plane buffer info
* Contains baseMonoTimeNs and baseUnixTimeMs for timestamp alignment

### Passthrough Camera (Raw YUV)
- Raw YUV frames are stored as `.yuv` files under `left_camera_raw/` and `right_camera_raw/`.
- Image format and buffer information are provided in the accompanying `*_camera_image_format.json` files.

To convert passthrough YUV (YUV_420_888) images to RGB for visualization or reconstruction, see: [Meta Quest 3D Reconstruction](https://github.com/t-34400/metaquest-3d-reconstrucion)

### Depth Map Descriptor CSV

* Format:

  ```
  timestamp_ms,ovr_timestamp,create_pose_location_x, ..., create_pose_rotation_w,
  fov_left_angle_tangent,fov_right_angle_tangent,fov_top_angle_tangent,fov_down_angle_tangent,
  near_z,far_z,width,height
  ```

### Depth Map

* Raw `.float32` depth images (1D float per pixel)

To convert raw depth maps into linear or 3D form, refer to the companion project: [Meta Quest 3D Reconstruction](https://github.com/t-34400/metaquest-3d-reconstrucion)

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### For End Users

1. Download the APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/t-34400/QuestRealityCapture/releases)
2. Install with ADB:

   ```bash
   adb install QuestRealityCapture.apk
   ```
3. Launch the app on **Meta Quest 3 or 3s** (firmware **v74+** required)
4. When the green instruction panel appears, press the **menu button on the left controller** to dismiss it and start logging
5. Data will be saved under the session folder as described above

Required permissions (camera/scene access) are requested automatically at runtime.

### For Developers

To customize the capture frame rate or set up synchronized capture:

1. Open the project in Unity **6000.0.30f1**
2. Open the scene: `Assets/RealityLog/Scenes/RealityLogScene.unity`
3. Set up the **CaptureCoordinator** component:
   - Create a GameObject with the `CaptureCoordinator` component
   - Set the **Target Capture FPS** (default: 3 FPS)
   - Wire up references in `DepthMapExporter` and `ImageReaderSurfaceProvider` components
4. Connect coordinator lifecycle to recording start/stop events
5. Build and deploy to your Quest device

See [docs/FPS_CONTROL.md](docs/FPS_CONTROL.md) for detailed setup and configuration instructions.
